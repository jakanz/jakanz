Hi! I'm Amira, a computer science major at Boise State. I'm sort of a jack of all trades and yet a master at none. You'll find most of my time and energy on this account dedicated to web development. As I live on, this account will likely become more full with interesting and increasingly complex projects.
As of writing, I'm currently developing and working on a repository for media that captured the events of September 11th, which I expect to fully release sometime early next year.
